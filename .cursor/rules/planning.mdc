# Planning & Feature Documentation

## Feature Documentation Process

### When User Requests a Feature Plan (NOT Execution)

When the user requests a new feature or asks to plan a feature (without saying "execute"):

1. **First, check the `docs/` folder** for existing feature documentation
   - Read existing feature documentation files if they exist
   - Understand the current feature plans and structure

2. **Generate a feature name** based on the requested functionality
   - Use kebab-case for file names (e.g., `user-login.md`, `news-list.md`, `news-detail.md`)
   - Make the name descriptive and clear

3. **Create a feature documentation file** in the `docs/` folder
   - File format: `docs/{feature-name}.md`
   - Include the feature name as the title
   - Document the feature requirements, implementation details, and any relevant information
   - **DO NOT implement the feature** - only create the documentation

4. **Structure of the feature documentation file**:
   ```markdown
   # {Feature Name}

   ## Overview
   [Brief description of the feature]

   ## Requirements
   [List of requirements]

   ## Implementation Details
   [Technical implementation details]

   ## Components/Pages
   [List of components or pages needed]

   ## API/Data
   [API endpoints or data sources]

   ## Notes
   [Any additional notes or considerations]
   ```

5. **Ensure the `docs/` folder exists** before creating the file
   - If the folder doesn't exist, create it first

### When User Requests to Execute a Feature Plan

When the user explicitly asks to "execute" a feature plan (e.g., "execute home.md", "execute this plan", "implement home.md"):

1. **Read the feature documentation** from the `docs/` folder
   - Read the specific feature documentation file mentioned
   - Understand the requirements and implementation details

2. **Implement the feature** according to the documentation
   - Create all necessary files (screens, components, hooks, stores, etc.)
   - Follow the project structure and best practices
   - Use the implementation details from the documentation

3. **Follow the project structure**:
   - Screens go in `screens/` folder (root level)
   - Components go in `components/{type}/` folders
   - Hooks go in `hooks/` folder
   - Stores go in `stores/` folder
   - Services/API go in `services/` folder
   - Types go in `types/` folder

## Examples

### Example 1: Planning a Feature
If user asks: "I want to add a search feature for news"

Response should:
- Check `docs/` folder first for existing documentation
- Generate feature name: `news-search.md`
- Create file: `docs/news-search.md`
- Document the search feature requirements and implementation plan
- **DO NOT implement** - only create documentation

### Example 2: Executing a Feature Plan
If user asks: "execute home.md" or "execute this plan" or "implement home.md"

Response should:
- Read `docs/home.md` file
- Implement all features according to the documentation
- Create all necessary files and components
- Follow the project structure and best practices
